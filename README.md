# TicTakToe

This is the first unit project of the java immersive coding cohort I am in. I this project I will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a interactive Tic tac toe game. 

I will be using these five userstories to develop my program;

# USERSTORIES

1. As a user, I should be able to start a new tic tac toe game
2. As a user, I should be able to click on a square to add X first and then O, and so on
3. As a user, I should be shown a message after each turn for if I win, lose, tie or who's turn it is next
4. As a user, I should not be able to click the same square twice
5. As a user, I should be shown a message when I win, lose or tie
